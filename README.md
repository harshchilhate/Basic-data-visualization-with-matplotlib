## Generating Data — Data Visualization & Simulation with Python

This project is based on **Chapter 15 (Generating Data)** from *Python Crash Course*.  
It explores how data can be **generated programmatically**, **simulated using rules and randomness**, and **visualized effectively** using Python.

The work progresses from basic plotting to simulation-driven and probability-based visualization.

## Chapter 15 Completion Notes

This project completes Chapter 15 of *Python Crash Course*.

Through this chapter, I learned how to:
- Generate data programmatically
- Simulate systems using randomness and rules
- Analyze frequency distributions
- Visualize data using both Matplotlib and Plotly
- Interpret probability through repeated experiments
- Refactor code for clarity and reuse

This chapter helped build strong intuition for simulation-based thinking, which is foundational for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.
