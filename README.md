## Generating Data — Data Visualization & Simulation with Python

This project is based on **Chapter 15 (Generating Data)** from *Python Crash Course*.  
It explores how data can be **generated programmatically**, **simulated using rules and randomness**, and **visualized effectively** using Python.

The work progresses from basic plotting to simulation-driven visualization.

## 📌 What This Project Covers

### 1. Basic Data Visualization (Matplotlib Fundamentals)
- Line plots and scatter plots
- Explicit data mapping (x vs y)
- Plot styling using built-in styles
- Axis labels, titles, and tick customization
- Custom colors and colormaps
- Programmatic saving of plots

---

### 2. Random Walk Simulation
- Object-oriented design using a `RandomWalk` class
- Rule-based random movement generation
- Simulation of stochastic systems
- Visualization of random paths using scatter plots
- Color gradients to represent progression over time
- Highlighting start and end points
- Generating multiple random walks interactively

---

### 3. Modified & Physical Interpretations of Random Walks
- Molecular-motion–style walks using restricted step sizes
- Modified rules to study how local changes affect global behavior
- Understanding emergent patterns from simple rules
- Refactoring code to improve clarity and configurability without changing behavior

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- How raw data is transformed into meaningful visual representations
- Why explicit data mapping is critical for correct interpretation
- How randomness combined with simple rules creates complex behavior
- How simulations are built using iterative systems
- How visualization helps validate and understand simulated systems
- The importance of refactoring for clean, readable, and maintainable code
